### In this chapter
    - Waiting for the right moment
    - Determining software requirements
    - Avoiding risks
    - Dealing with vendors

### **I. Putting Data-Mining Tools in Perspective**
    - It would not make sense to select tools, materials, or services until you have a plan, because the plan guides your understanding of what you will need and when, to build your house

#### **1. Avoiding software risks**
    - Risks:
        - Inadequate software capabilities
        - Overpaying
        - Unnecessary complexity

#### **2. Focusing on business goals, not tools**
    - Focus on issues that are important to the business and your management.
    - Respect deadlines.
    - Make the most of your resources: 
        - Your time and the time of other team members are even more valuable.
    - Build credibility step by step: 
        - talk about dollars and cents, not fancy math
        - Present only information that is directly related to the business goal.

#### **3. Determining what you need**
    - Be inclusive when seeking input
    - Show respect for each person you interview and listen thoughtfully.
    - Share your data

#### **4. Comparing tools**
    - Functions: What do you need your software to do?
    - Interface
    - Services (supporting)
    - Information resources: Documentation, community,...


#### **5. Shopping for software**
    - Do prioritize requirements
    - Do test the tools you are considering: should choose the one that is easy to use
    - Do insist on getting satisfactory answers to your technical questions
    - Don’t rely on any vendor for information about the offerings of a competing vendor.
    - Don’t use vendors as your sole information source, even for information about the vendor’s own products.
    - Don’t skimp on training
    - Don’t ignore warnings

### **II. Evaluating Software**
    - Select something that lets you get where you need to go for a reasonable cost.
    - Take into account all costs:
        - Product costs
        - Technical supports
        - Training
        - Labor
    - FREE SOFTWARE ISN’T ALWAYS FREE!: Read user agreements and make sure that you understand and respect them

#### **1. Don’t fall in love (with your software)**

    - Conditions are also changing. => should update

#### **2. Engaging with sales representatives**
    - to be supported about licences, training, ...

#### **3. The sales professional’s mantra — BANT**
    - The combination of Budget, Authority, Needs, and Timeframe (BANT) is widely accepted as a standard for “qualifying” a sales lead
    - Consider:
        - Budget
        - Authority
        - Needs
        - Time frame
