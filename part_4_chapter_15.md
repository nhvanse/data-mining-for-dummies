## **Chapter 15: Your Exciting Career in Modeling**

### In this chapter
-  Harnessing mathematical models
- Investigating decision trees
-  Exposing the inner workings of neural networks

### Note
- data -> pattern -> prediction -> decision
- So, at its simplest level, a mathematical model is a prediction-making machine.

### Decision Tree
- Example

### Neural networks
- Neural networks started out as models of the workings of the human brain.

- **block box** <- the resulting models are not easily understood by intuition
- Model: Multi layer perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), Bayesian Network,...


### Clustering
- Clustering techniques are mathematical processes for unsupervised learning, organizing the cases in your data into similar groups.
