## Chapter 9: Making New Data

### In this chapters
- Enriching data-mining resources with loyalty programs
- Conducting experiments (no lab coat required)
- Using survey research



### **I. Fathoming Loyalty Programs**
#### **1. Grasping the loyalty concept**
- A loyalty program is an agreement between a business and its customers:
    - customer: recieve rewards, lower prices, services,...
    - company: can track customers 's actions, behaviors,... => data for analysis
- Online retailers have special advantages:
    - can track bahaviors without rewards

#### **2. Data**
- Customer location
- Products purchased
- Combinations of products purchased together
- Prices paid
- List or everyday prices (often different from the price the customer paid)
- Coupon or other discount offer used
- Time that a purchase took place
- Detailed product descriptions
- Pages/products viewed
- Time on site
- Timing of site visits
- Product reviews and information sharing
- Referrals (for example, did the customer come directly to the site, or via a link from another site, or a link in an email?)
- Offers or ads that the customer viewed
- Social network details, such as people the customer knows
#### **3. Putting loyalty data to work**
- It is necessary to take a proactive role. 
-  Executives already know what has happened, and they need you to show them how they can influence what happens next.
- Discover:
    - Characteristics of customers who buy large quantities of a product
    - Characteristics of customers who are increasing the amount they buy
    - Growing customer segments
    - Combinations of products that are often bought together
    - Promotions that work better than others
    - Marketing channels that are more cost-effective than others
    - Shopper behavior patterns (in-store and online) that affect sales
    - Unexpected factors (or combinations of factors) that influence sales


### **II. Testing, testing ...**
- conduct controlled experiments over and over

#### **1. Experimenting in direct marketing**
- direct marketing:
    - send sms, email
    - contact individual people
#### **2. Spying test opportunities**
- Whenever you have a list of people and an action you want them to take, think about testing
- Common examples of things you can test include:
    - Copy: Short versus long, messaging, or variations in wording
    - Layout: Images, white space, fonts
    - Envelope: Colors, shape, paper stock
    - Printing: Color, text, images
    - Enclosures: Gifts (such as address labels, greeting cards, cash, or other items of value), return envelopes, thank-you notes, giving/purchasing history
    - Subject lines: Topic, wording, use of recipient name
    - Offer: Price, packaging, shipping

#### **3. Testing online**
- A/B testing tool, 
- Multivariate testing tool, 
- Split testing tool.

### **III. Microtargeting to Win Elections**

#### **1. Treating voters as individuals**
- An online store doesn’t show the same ads and products to everyone (better than offline store)
- And that online store tests every element of the presentation (offer, text, images, layout, and more) to find out what works best.
- Microtargeting uses information about individuals to personalize the campaign.

#### **2. Gaining an information advantage**

#### **3. Developing your own test data**

### **IV. Surveying the Public Landscape**

- **Surveys** may be the most common and familiar approach for obtaining your own unique data from people

#### **1. Eliciting information with surveys**
- Typical survey questions are about:
    - **Demographics**: Age, gender, occupation
    - **Behavior**: Purchasing or using specific products, spending patterns, participating in social or athletic activities
    - **Intentions**: Vote or not vote, candidate A or B, hire fewer or more new staff members next year
    - **Attitudes**: Often concerning current political or social issues

- Good survey research offers you the advantages of
    - **Flexibility**: You pose questions about any topic you choose. So you can always get information that is relevant, even for topics where no other data sources are available to you.
    - **Speed**: Surveys are quick to set up and conduct, so your data will be up to date.
    - **Depth**: Use surveys to fill in the information gaps that other data sources leave open.
    - **Privacy**: You’re not obliged to share the results with anyone. You’ll have an information edge over competitors.

#### **2. Developing questions**
- A good survey question should be
    - Specific
    - Narrow
    - Neutral
    - Clear
- Response options should be:
    - Simple
    - Consistent
    - Complete: full range of options
    - Distinct

#### **3. Conducting surveys**
- select one or more channels for reaching your respondents:
    - Face to face
    - Paper or kiosk
    - Mail
    - Telephone
    - Internet

#### **4. Recognizing limitations**
- Some people are hard to reach; others are reluctant to participate
- Some questions are hard for respondent to answer

#### **5. Bringing in help**
- You are busy. You can use serveys from:
    - American Association for Public Opinion Research
    - American Marketing Association
    - Advertising Research Foundation
    - Marketing Research Association
    - ...

### **V. Getting into the Field**
- Going where no data miner has gone before
    - look into your options before going out to get data
    - can get data from others
- Doing more than asking
    - Surveys are nothing more than asking people for data
    - You can observe their behaviors directly, using video and other methods, instead of asking retailers,...

### **VI. One Challenge, Many Approaches**
- You may face technical challenges, legal issues, or high costs => You can  look for alternative (and easier) ways to solve your problem
- Think creatively, look to others for ideas, and make peace with imperfection. 
- Data mining is all about getting useful information now, not perfect information at some time in the future.
