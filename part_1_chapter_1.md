# Part 1: Getting Started with Data Mining
### What to learn:
- Understanding how data miners work
- Looking over a data miners shoulder
- Working constructively with your counterparts on complementary professions
- Keeping it legal with good data privacy protection
- Communicating with executives

## Chapter 1: Catching the Data-Mining Train
Most organizations have huge data but they aren't getting much valuee fron what they have.
As a data miner, it's your mission to make the most of the data you have.

### Getting Real about Data Mining
- Data miners have to work and think to make valuable discoveries.
- Data miners are **ordinary**, motivated people who complement their business knowledge with the fundamentals of data analysis.

### Not your professor's statistics 
- Business problems can be solved using less formal methods than the ones you learned at school
- Data mining: using a range of data analysis techniques to uncover useful information from data and put that information into practical use.

### The value of data mining
- actions to make your business run more smoothly and generate more revenue
- cut costs without damaging the organization
- help you to better understand how your business works

### Working for it 
- You do need to have some basic computer skills and a feel for numbers. 
- You must also have patience and the ability to work in a methodical way.
- Data mining is hard work. It’s not hard like mining coal or performing brain surgery, but it’s hard. It takes patience, organization, and effort.

### Doing what Data Miners do
- Data mining is like metal mining
- Data miners do get down and dirty with data

### Focusing on the business
- Every data-mining project begins with a specific business problem and a goal to match.
- Your own business knowledge is very important. 
- You must understand problems, needs, and preferences, and focus your efforts on providing information that supports good business decisions.

### Understanding how data miners spend their time
- Data miners spend a lot of time on **preparation**

### Getting to know the data-mining process
- Popular data-mining process, **CRISP-DM**:
    1. Business Understanding 
    2. Data Understanding
    3. Data Preparation
    4. Modeling
    5. Evaluation
    6. Deployment

### Making models
- Models help you understand the factors that impact sales, the actions that tend to increase or decrease sales, and the strategies and tactics that keep your business running smoothly. 

### Understanding mathematical models
- A mathematical model is, plain and simple, an equation, or set of equations, that describe a relationship between two or more things.
- Example: predictive model, statistical model, linear model, etc
- In data mining, we create models by **finding patterns** in data using machine learning or statistical methods.

### Putting information into action
- Incorporate predictions into a report or presentation to be used in making a specific decision.
- Integrate the model into an operational system to provide real-time predictions for everyday use
- Use the model for batch predictions

### Discovering Tools and Methods
- Visual programming: visual programming interface
- Working quick and dirty by breaking some rules
- Testing, testing, and testing some more
