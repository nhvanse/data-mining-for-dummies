# Part 4: A Data Miner’s Survival Kit

## **Chapter 14: Showing your data who's boss**

### In this chapter
- Picking and choosing data
- Recycling variables
- Consolidating data

### Note
- Your effort will be rewarded, because good data preparation lays the groundwork for excellent data-mining results.
- If you want to become an outstanding data miner, make routine investments of your own time and patience to develop your data preparation skills. You’ll need two kinds of information:
    - Types of data manipulation
    - Capabilities and methods within your tools

### Data manipulation methods
- **Rearranging data**
    - Controllinng variable (column) order
        - Actions in tool: drag and drop, up and down buttons, selection order, sort gestures,...
    - Formatting data properly
        - ex: zipcode -> category number
    - Labeling data
        - Using labels to explain meaning of variable (1 -> East, 2 -> West,...) in tool (description)
    - Change the order of rows
    - Transpose rows and columns if they are in wrong position

- **Sifting Out the Data You Need**
    - Narrowing the fields
        - `selection` or `filtering`
        - dont use unnecessary variables
    - Selecting relevant cases
        - Removing incomplete cases is one common example of data selection, or filtering.
    - Sampling
        - more data is better data
        - find word `sample` or `split`
    - Getting the Data Together
        - **Merging** 2 datasets with different variables
        - **Appending**
    - Making New Data from Old Data
        - Deriving new variables: A+B = C
        - Aggregation: compute total, average, ...
- **Saving time by using special tools**
    - Remove missing values
    - Weighting
    - Split file
    - ...
